To inform the planning and provision of cancer treatment services, analyse breast cancer incidence data from the NHS Borders health board. Findings should be presented in a report of 1-2 pages, highlighting any significant insights and identified trends.

## Conclusions

- Screening data should be reviewed to establish if the resulting back-log from COVID-19 has been cleared in order to establish whether a further increase in incidences should be anticipated in 2022.

- Resources should be allocated according to the observed trend of increased incidences every three years

- Research/Analysis should be conducted to further understand and confirm any reason for this trend, including any links to screening schedules.

- Research/Analysis should be conducted to establish whether increased incidence with age is in any way the result of current screening criteria and if therefor screening criteria should be widened.

- Long term service planning should take into consideration the ~4% projected population increase of the female 50-70 demographic in NHS Borders, as projected by the National Records of Scotland.
